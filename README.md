# React Basic Form

This project demonstrates how to create a basic form in React using JSX elements. The form includes various input fields such as text inputs, email input, phone input, radio buttons, checkboxes, file upload, URL input, select dropdown, and textarea.
The form state is managed using React's useState hook, which allows for efficient state management and re-rendering when input values change. The project showcases handling form submissions, resetting form values, and updating state based on user input.

# Key features:

- Form built with JSX elements
- State management using useState hook
- Handling form submissions with handleSubmit function
- Resetting form values with handleReset function
- Updating state based on user input
- Handling checkbox group state with handleSubjectChange function
- Rendering dynamic options for select dropdown
- Basic form validation using HTML5 required attribute

This simple project serves as a starting point for understanding how to build forms in React and manage state effectively. 
It can be extended further by adding more advanced features like form validation, submission handling, and integration with backend APIs.
